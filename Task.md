#Git Commands

In this file, you can fin some of the most important commands or cheats that exists in git.

##Configuration

Obviously, we need to set up our environment in which we are going to work. For this, git provides us some cheats to set default values. For example:

`$ git config --global user.name "Your name"` 
This set us the name that will be attached tp our commits and tags.

`$ git config --global user.email "Your email"`
It is like the previous one, just that is our email, not our name (It shows in commits and tags).

## Start

Then, we have to start our project, for this, git gives us these tools:

`$ git init [project name]`
This will create a local repository inside of a directory created locally as well.

`$ git clone [project url]`
This comman will download a project from a remote repository.
